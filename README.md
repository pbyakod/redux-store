## Short Description

This React store application has been refactored and modified to use redux instead of context api

## Installation

To install this engine on your local device, clone the repository using the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/pbyakod/redux-store.git
```

Next, open up the root directory and run

```
npm i
```

This will install all the packages you need to run the app. Once complete, seed the data

```

```

And finally start the application

```
npm run develop
```
Note: Ideally, your computer will redirect you to the page automatically. If that doesn't happen, click on https://localhost:3000 after running the develop command.
